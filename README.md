We made a simple student information system a web page for students to submit their information, with a table displaying relevant data and a dropdown for selecting final grades.

Below is a brief explanation of each of the html files:

enrollment.html: This file contains a form or interface for students to enroll in courses. It may display available courses and allow students to select and submit their choices.
grades.html: This file displays a student's grades for their enrolled courses. It may present the grades in a table or list format, possibly with additional details like course names, credit hours, etc.
list.html: This file shows a list of all students, classes, or courses. The exact content would depend on the context, but it's generally a list or table of items in the system.
submit.html: It is a form for submitting student information, including a dropdown to select a final grade. It may be used by teachers or administrators to input or update student data.
